STEPS TO FOLLOW - IMPLEMENTING MODEL FIRST APPROACH OF ENTITY FRAMEWORK:

Step 1:  Create either a WebApi Empty project or just an empty project
Step 2:  Install Entity Framework using "Manage Nugest Packages: option
Step 3:  Create new "ADO.NET Entity Data Model" by right clicking on "Models" folder:
         - Pick "Empty EF Designer Model" option from "Choose Model Contents"
		 - Add New Entity by right clicking on .edmx
		 - Create new scalar and navigation properties for the entity
Step 4:  Pick "Generate Database from Model" option by right clicking on .edmx
         - Create new connection by providing nme of the database
		 - At this time the .edmx will generate the .sql file
		 - Select the appropriate "EF DbContext Generator" to generate model classes
Step 5:  Execute above generated .sql to actully create the database and tables
Step 6:  To update database following this approach, we need to either:
         - Follow Database First approach way, by making changes to existing database nd pulling the changes by
		   using "Update Model from Database" option from context menu of .edmx   OR
		 - Re-generate the database by following step 4 (possibly step 3 also)
